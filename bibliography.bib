abstract = {Social licence to mine is influenced by society’s perception of the mining sector’s ability to effectively rehabilitate mined land and for governments to appropriately regulate that process for the broader community benefit. In Queensland, Australia, many mine rehabilitation personnel working for active coalmines, as either staff, consultants or contractors, belong to the Central Queensland Mine Rehabilitation Group (CQMRG). The CQMRG was established 23 years ago with the aim of sharing informal knowledge related to practical aspects of rehabilitation in order to leave as positive a legacy as possible from mined land. This voluntary group of professionals also includes members from regulatory agencies and civil society. Within the dynamic regional mining environment, mine rehabilitation professionals benefit from sharing their informal knowledge.CQMRG is currently a group in transition. Mining boom and downturn cycles have exacerbated the loss of accumulated knowledge in the core CQMRG membership due to rapid changes in personnel at mines in the region. Additionally, some of the most experienced CQMRG-affiliated rehabilitation practitioners are approaching the end of their careers and want their valuable and less formal knowledge retained. This paper discusses the development of a research project that emerged in response to the anticipated loss of several decades’ worth of valuable knowledge as rehabilitation practitioners in CQMRG left the region or the workforce.CITATION:Unger, C J, Bond, C J, Baumgartl, T, Glenn, V C and Sabourenkov, P, 2016. ‘MRC-wiki’ – a mine rehabilitation and closure knowledge management tool for Central Queensland coalmine practitioners, in Proceedings Life-of-Mine 2016 Conference, pp 39–42 (The Australasian Institute of Mining and Metallurgy: Melbourne).},

abstract = {<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title> <jats:sec> <jats:title>Background</jats:title> <jats:p>Vancomycin efficacy is optimally predicted by the area under the concentration–time profile (AUC24), however, traditional AUC24-based dosing methods involve analytic PK calculations that require both peak and trough drug levels, increasing cost and time compared with trough-based dosing. Recent literature (e.g., Rybak et al 2019) suggest that Bayesian dosing tools alleviate the cost and difficulty of implementing AUC24-based dosing in order to improve patient outcomes. In this study, we compare therapeutic range attainment across 5 hospitals using trough-based dosing vs. 5 hospitals using Bayesian-supported AUC24 dosing.</jats:p> </jats:sec> <jats:sec> <jats:title>Methods</jats:title> <jats:p>De-identified data were available from 5 hospitals across the United States, EU, and Australia that used a trough-based dosing method (375 adult patients, 13,024 doses, 4,654 drug levels), and from 5 hospitals that implemented Bayesian-based AUC24 dosing (370 patients, 13,080 doses, 3,520 drug levels) using commercially available software (DoseMeRx). The proportion of doses in the therapeutic target range was determined for each hospital, and the number and cost of therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM) levels required were compared.</jats:p> </jats:sec> <jats:sec> <jats:title>Results</jats:title> <jats:p>In the 5 trough-based dosing hospitals, only 49.1% of doses achieved the therapeutic target of 10–20mg/L with significant variance per-hospital in the proportion of sub- and supra-therapeutic doses (range 11–35% and 14–41% respectively). Hospitals that implemented Bayesian-based AUC24 dosing successfully attained the target AUC24 (400–700mg.h/L) for 73.5% of doses, similar to a previous AUC24-based dosing intervention using increased sampling intensity (Meng et al. 2019). The number of TDM levels used for trough-based dosing was 1 per 1.34 days compared with 1 per 2.14 days in the AUC24 group (37.4% fewer levels). Bayesian-based AUC24 dosing hospitals not only avoided increased TDM costs, but counter-intuitively had decreased cost relative to the trough-based group. At a cost of $35USD per level (Meng et al. 2019), for a 500-bed hospital, this equates to savings of $60,305 per annum.</jats:p> </jats:sec> <jats:sec> <jats:title>Conclusion</jats:title> <jats:p>This study demonstrates that implementing Bayesian-based AUC24 dosing results in improved therapeutic target attainment. TDM levels were less frequent in the Bayesian-based AUC24 dosing group, leading to decreased cost.</jats:p> </jats:sec> <jats:sec> <jats:title>Disclosures</jats:title> <jats:p>All authors: No reported disclosures.</jats:p> </jats:sec},

Three population PK models, Buelga et al. (2005), Goti et al. (2018), and an obese-specific model, Adane et al. (2015), were used to predict plasma concentrations at the time of each recorded vancomycin assay, and their accuracy and bias were compared. Goodness of fit at both the population and individual level was assessed, and elastic net regression was used to identify any sources of predictive error in the obese-specific model. Model parameters for each model were then re-estimated, and a variety of body size metrics were evaluated.</jats:p> </jats:sec> <jats:sec> <jats:title>Results</jats:title> <jats:p>The Buelga et al. one-compartment model had the best predictive ability (Table 1). In all models, bias (calculated as MME; mean per-patient mean predictive error) by obesity class was observed at both the population and individual levels, and unexpectedly was largest in the obese-specific model. In the obese-specific model, predictive error correlated with the use of TBW as a model covariate. A set of models derived from Adane et al. model were then developed to correct for weight. Using ideal body weight (IBW) on Vd and no correction for weight on CL provided the best fit. The derived model accounted for 81% of variance in plasma concentration and exhibited negligible bias by obesity class (population MME = -0.75 (i), -0.06 (ii), and -0.50 (iii) mg/L; individual MME = −0.20 (i), −0.02 (ii), and −0.02 (iii) mg/L).</jats:p> </jats:sec> <jats:sec> <jats:title>Conclusion</jats:title> <jats:p>Existing vancomycin population PK models for use in the obese population are biased in higher obesity classes due to the use of total body weight. A novel population PK model developed using ideal body weight exhibits negligible bias across obesity classes as well as improved predictive ability.</jats:p> <jats:p /> </jats:sec> <jats:sec> <jats:title>Disclosures</jats:title> <jats:p>All authors: No reported disclosures.</jats:p> </jats:sec},
